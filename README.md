# Hassan Negm – Elevator Engineering Journey 🚀

## 👤 About Me
I'm **Hassan Negm**, a graduate of **Tanta University – Faculty of Engineering, Electronics & Communications Department**.  
Over the past year, I have built hands-on experience in the **elevator industry**, combining both **mechanical** and **electrical** knowledge.  
My journey includes practical fieldwork, technical training, and direct involvement in **sales & marketing** of elevators.

## 📘 Training & Courses
- **Classic Control Course – AMIT Learning**  
  Gained strong foundations in electrical control circuits, relay logic, and troubleshooting.  
  This knowledge directly supports my work in elevator control systems, including Turkish cards like **Eltronic, Hussein, Kas, and Hidrosen**.

## 🛠️ Technical Experience
### Electrical & Mechanical Work  
- Tested and troubleshooted **3-phase supply issues**, bridge rectifiers, and relays.  
- Worked with **VFDs (inverters):** error codes, phase monitoring, and programming basics.  
- Practical experience in **gearbox vs gearless machines**, alignment, and cabin installation.  
- Ensured **welding quality** and support structure stability, especially in **tower-type installations**.  

### Fault Handling Approach  
1. Check the **3-phase input**.  
2. Inspect **bridge rectifier & relays**.  
3. Test **wiring connections**.  
4. Diagnose **VFD errors** (overcurrent, undervoltage, etc.).  
5. Confirm **mechanical alignment** of guides, cabin, and machine mounting.  

### Commissioning & Handover (Mechanical & Electrical)  
- Review **shaft dimensions and verticality** (using plumb line, laser level, or total station).  
- Check **steel supports, welding quality**, and correct positioning of guides.  
- Inspect **door verticality** and cabin alignment.  
- Verify **machine placement and installation** (gearless vs geared).  
- Final **electrical handover:** testing DBs, controllers, and safety circuits.

## 🛠 Local Controllers & Handover Process  
- Experienced in assembling and wiring **local controllers**.  
- Hands-on with **control board testing** and connection verification.  
- Practical knowledge of **handover process**, including inspection checklists and client acceptance steps.

## 💼 Sales & Marketing Achievements
Alongside technical experience, I worked in **marketing & direct sales** of elevators:  

- Built strong communication with clients, balancing technical explanation and business value.  
- Matched customer needs with the right elevator solutions (residential vs tower).  
- Focused on **after-sales service** to strengthen trust and reputation.  

📊 **Results in One Year**:  
- **Total Sales:** ~5.2 Million EGP.  
- **Projects:** 5 elevators installed.  
  - 1 **tower elevator**.  
  - 4 **residential elevators** (~8 floors each).  
- **Residential package value:** ~700k–800k EGP.
