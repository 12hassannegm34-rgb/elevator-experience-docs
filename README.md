## 🛠️ Technical Experience
### Electrical & Mechanical Work
- Tested and troubleshooted **3-phase supply issues**, **bridge rectifiers**, and **relays**.  
- Worked with **VFDs (inverters)**: understanding error codes, phase monitoring, and programming basics.  
- Practical experience in **gearbox vs gearless machines**, alignment, and cabin installation.  
- Ensured **welding quality** and **support structure stability**, especially in **tower-type installations**.  

### Fault Handling Approach
1. Check the **3-phase input**.  
2. Inspect **bridge rectifier & relays**.  
3. Test wiring connections.  
4. Diagnose **VFD errors** (overcurrent, undervoltage, etc.).  
5. Confirm **mechanical alignment** of guides, cabin, and machine mounting.
